# -lexicographically-smallest-and-largest-substrings
We define the following terms:

Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows: 
For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.

A substring of a string is a contiguous block of characters in the string. For example, the substrings of abc are a, b, c, ab, bc, and abc.
Given a string,s , and an integer,k , complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length k.

Input Format

The first line contains a string denoting s . 
The second line contains an integer denoting k.

Constraints

s consists of English alphabetic letters only (i.e., [a-zA-Z]).
Output Format
